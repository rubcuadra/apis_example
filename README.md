Quick example 4 implementing APIs Rest with Client side code, we use SoundCloud API; Used for teaching purpose @ Laboratoria 

You must have Python and Flask  
*This was because I read somewhere that you must render the html from the server in order for the soundcloud widget to work, actually I guess that was fake so you could simply download the index.html and add the script somewhere and it should work*

* Download the repo and cd inside it
* python application.py
* Open your browser and then go to http://localhost:8000/

**IMPORTANT:** You must add your *clientId* inside the soundcloud.js , you can obtain one [here](https://soundcloud.com/you/apps)
